# Advanced Predictive Models and Applications for Business Analytics
### <center> IDS 576 </center> 

### Informal name: Deep Learning, Graphical Models and Reinforcement Learning

<span style="color:red">All announcements will be made on the [Forum](https://forum.chicagods.com) </span>


## Overview

The goal of this class is to cover a subset of advanced machine learning techniques, after students have seen the basics of data mining (such as in in IDS 572) and machine learning (such as in IDS 575). Broadly, we will cover topics spanning graphical models, deep learning and reinforcement learning. Graphical models are useful for inferring outcomes and making predictions conditional on preceding/related events, even when we do not have full information. They have found success in tracking, speech recognition, language modeling (Hidden Markov Models), image segmentation (Markov Random Fields) and other applications. Similarly, we will study popular deep learning architectures, their design choices and how they are trained. We will also study recurrent and convolutional architectures which achieve state of the art in challenging prediction tasks in text and computer vision applications. Finally, we will look at online and reinforcement learning problems and their role in sequential decision making problem areas such as transportation and retail.
