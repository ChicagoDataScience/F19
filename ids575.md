# Statistical Models and Methods for Business Analytics
### <center> IDS 575 </center> 


<span style="color:red">All announcements will be made on the [Forum](https://forum.chicagods.com) </span>

## Overview

The goal of this class is to cover the foundations of modern statistics and machine learning methods complementing the data mining focus of IDS 572. In other words, you will get up to speed with the requisite background, as well as the key theoretical underpinnings of modern analytics. We will do so through the lens of statistical machine learning. Lectures will be complemented with hands-on exercises in R.
